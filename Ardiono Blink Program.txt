This is the simple Arduino Blink Program With Some Modification
In this The Led On PIN 13 Will Blink 10 times Faster And 10 Times Slower.
When blinking quickly, the LED should have a 0.2 second period, so it should be high for 0.1 seconds and low for 0.1 seconds. 
When blinking slowly, the LED should have a 2 second period, so it should be high for 1 seconds and low for 1 seconds. 
The LED should continue to blink in this alternating fashion for as long as the Arduino receives power.
